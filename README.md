## Blog-Portal
```
This project allows a user to view blogs of other users, post their own blogs by
logging in after being registered. Registered users can also comment on different blogs of different
users. Users can also update their blogs. This project also has preprocessing required like
authentication and authorization, handling exceptions and automated test cases. I created the
backend of this project hence used NodeJs, ExpressJS, MongoDB as database and Jest for
automated testing.
